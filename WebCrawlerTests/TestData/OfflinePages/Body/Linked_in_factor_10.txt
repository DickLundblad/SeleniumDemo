About the job
Do you believe that software can make the world a radically better place? Do you get your kicks from solving complex business problems alongside smart people? Do you want to work remotely and still build close relationships with your colleagues and customers?

factor10 is a small, remote-first Swedish software consultancy who travel within Sweden for client work as needed. We’re technologists solving complex, commercial problems. Consultants who TDD their way to transformation. Software engineers who don’t start with the tech-stack. Repeating what’s been done before is not our job. Customers describe us as ‘revenue releasers’ and we like to be ‘bottleneck openers.’ If you join us, you’ll be getting new products to market quicker, helping businesses embrace digitization and innovate new business models and delivering better software together, faster.
